# Automated-Guided-Vehicle-AGV-using-ROS

This project is in development and focuses on creating an intelligent Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) for warehouse management using Robot Operating System (ROS). The AGV utilizes a Raspberry Pi 5 for processing and leverages the combined capabilities of a LiDAR sensor and ultrasonic sensors for robust navigation and obstacle avoidance.

Key Features (under development):

ROS Framework: Employs the robust and flexible ROS framework to facilitate communication between sensors, actuators, and decision-making algorithms.

Raspberry Pi 5 Processing Power: Harnesses the processing power of the Raspberry Pi 5 for real-time sensor data analysis and control decisions.

LiDAR-based Navigation: Utilizes a LiDAR sensor to create a detailed map of the warehouse environment, enabling precise path planning and obstacle detection.

Ultrasonic Sensor Integration: Complements LiDAR with ultrasonic sensors for enhanced obstacle detection, particularly in close proximity to the AGV.


Project Goals:

Develop an efficient and adaptable AGV system for warehouse automation.
Leverage ROS for seamless integration of sensors, actuators, and control algorithms.
Utilize LiDAR and ultrasonic sensors for comprehensive obstacle detection and navigation.

Project Status:

This project is currently under active development. We welcome contributions and discussions related to ROS-based AGV design, sensor integration, and path planning algorithms.

Feel free to star the repository and watch for updates as the project progresses!
