# Automated-Guided-Vehicle-AGV-using-ROS
This project is in development and focuses on creating an intelligent Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) for warehouse management using Robot Operating System (ROS). The AGV utilizes a Raspberry Pi 5 for processing and leverages the combined capabilities of a LiDAR sensor and ultrasonic sensors for robust navigation and obstacle avoidance.
